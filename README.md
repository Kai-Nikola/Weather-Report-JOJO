# Weather-Report-JOJO


Welcome to the Power BI Weather Dashboard project! This dashboard was created to demonstrate the capabilities of Power BI in fetching, processing, and visualizing real-time data from external APIs. The goal was to create a one-stop-shop for all essential weather and environmental information with a clean, modern user interface.

Key Features Include:

    Current Conditions: Real-time temperature, weather status (e.g., Mist), humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and UV index for a selected city.

    Multi-City View: Easily switch between pre-selected cities to compare weather conditions.

    7-Day Forecast: A visual line graph showing temperature trends for the upcoming week, accompanied by daily weather icons.

    Air Quality Index (AQI): A detailed AQI section with a primary gauge for PM10 and a specific breakdown of other key pollutants like O3, PM2.5, SO2, and CO.

    Sunrise & Sunset Times: Clear and precise times for the start and end of the day.

    Chance of Rain: A helpful bar chart that visualizes the probability of precipitation over the next several days.
